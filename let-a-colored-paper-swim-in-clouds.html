            <h2>Let a colored paper swim in clouds</h2>
            <br>
            <p>2025</p>
            <p>Solo exhibition at Moro Craft</p>
            <p>I developed “Transfer”, a piece I created in 2019, for a solo exhibition at Moro Craft.</p>
            <p>I choose colored paper with a certain intuitive image in mind and create a mold, imagining what shape it will take. The color of papers transfer to cement, and also the moisture of cement distort the shape of mold.</p>
            <p>From the time I pour cement onto the colored paper until it hardens, I cannot see what is happening inside.The transition that was in my imagination overlaps with the transition that is actually woven into the material. And the transition you feel when you see it.</p>
            <p>Colors that cannot be measured and that you perceive in the midst of real duration do not have names. Even the form as stagnation for a short time of its duration. Touch it with your hand. The present we are in is not an abstract point on a line, but an indivisible overlap of its touch, its immediate sensations, and its imagined (or past) duration. Let us assume that.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Material : White cement, Colored paper</p>
            <p>Size : Variable</p>
