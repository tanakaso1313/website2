            <p>Three-dimensional grid object made by assembling laser-cut parts from fiberboard (MDF or vulcanized fiber).
            Grid structures are like  “number with substance, Ewhich by itself means nothing. However, as soon as it is placed in a certain context (living space, urban space, field, etc.), it generates various meanings such as functionality and symbolism. It started with the construction of the pyramids in ancient Egypt and the demarcation of farmland in the Nairriver basin, and during the Italian Renaissance, Leonaludo da Vinci and Alberti utilized the mathematical grid and applied it to architecture and composition of paintings.
            In general, the grid system may be viewed as rigid and cold, the opposite of “humanistic E However, I am fascinated by the contradiction of this exact division without emotion and without end, as a backdrop to the free creative act of human beings. I dare to just stare at this existence. In the meantime, various meanings may emerge, and something that seems to be a function may snatch into view. Such geometrical behavior, which is usually hidden, begins to ripple lightly with the act of looking at it.</p>
