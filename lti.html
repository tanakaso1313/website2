            <p>Graduation project</p>
            <p>1.6 mm x 0.8 mm LED chips are embedded in the back of expanded metal, which is usually used as a building material, and a circuit made of copper foil is laid on the back side. LEDs illuminate the walls and supply light to the space through the metal.</p>
            <p>In commercial spaces and hotels, atmospheric lighting plans are often made with hidden light sources. On the other hand, many of the lighting fixtures are installed in an iconic form, which is close to being an objet d'art. Although it is installed as a lighting fixture, it has almost no properties as an object and feels like light itself, but I want to create a product that has a more attractive presence than the installed lighting.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Material : Steel, Copper, LED chips</p>
            <p>Size : 450ÁE50 ~ 900ÁE00 mm</p>
