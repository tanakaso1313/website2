            <h2>Liminal Lamp</h2>
            <br>
            <p>2025</p>
            <p>Self-initiated project</p>
            <p>The lamp is made of a three-dimensional grid structure based on parts cut from MDF. The structure not only floats the paper shade, but also serves as a path for the power cord and as a second diffuser by reflecting the light source. This lighting is designed to look at the wonder of the grid, which changes its meaning depending on its relationship with the surrounding things.</p>
