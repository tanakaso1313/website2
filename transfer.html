            <p>Self-initiated project</p>
            <p>Using colored paper, a mold was made in the manner of origami, and white cement was poured into it. The strong alkalinity of the cement dissolves the pigments of the colored paper and transfers them to the cement. The moisture in the cement before hardening distorts the paper mold, creating a unique shape. The shapes may appear to be out of order, but they are determined by the relationship between fluid and gravity.</p>
            <p>This is an experiment in the process of creating a minimum system by human hands and letting the natural behavior of the materials take over from there. All humans do is set up effective questions, observe the process, and choose the outcome.</p>

            <p>Material : White cement, Colored paper</p>
            <p>Size : Variable</p>
