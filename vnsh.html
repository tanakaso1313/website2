            <p>Light makes things visible in the darkness, but it also makes something invisible. You cannot see in a river reflecting daylight. Visibility is clearer on a cloudy day than on a sunny day. The moment lightning flashes, the area is covered in white darkness. While some things are made visible by light, others disappear from view without being noticed. 窶稀owever, people find uses and meanings for phenomena and natural objects, dividing this world into segments. People feel hope and safety in the presence of light, and have used light as a tool to illuminate their hand in the darkness. 窶・lt;vnsh&gt; takes the viewer out of this segmented world of perception, and light leaks through a slit in the 5mm-diameter aluminum pipe, illuminating the wall. When gazing at &lt;vnsh&gt;, which itself seems to disappear into the light due to its slenderness, the light speaks to the senses.</p>
