            <p>Light makes things visible in the darkness, but it also makes something invisible. You cannot see in a river reflecting daylight. Visibility is clearer on a cloudy day than on a sunny day. The moment lightning flashes, the area is covered in white darkness. While some things are made visible by light, others disappear from view without being noticed. ​However, people find uses and meanings for phenomena and natural objects, dividing this world into segments. People feel hope and safety in the presence of light, and have used light as a tool to illuminate their hand in the darkness.  Elt;vnsh&gt; takes the viewer out of this segmented world of perception, and light leaks through a slit in the 5mm-diameter aluminum pipe, illuminating the wall. When gazing at &lt;vnsh&gt;, which itself seems to disappear into the light due to its slenderness, the light speaks to the senses.</p>
